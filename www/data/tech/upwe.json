["While standing in a right neutral bow stance and with opponent attempting to kick you with his  right front kick, drop back with your right foot into a twist stance (left front) as you execute a right  downward block to the outside of his kicking leg (at this point your left hand is cocked up beside  your left ear, like in 'Thundering Hammers').","As opponent delivers a right punch, unpivot from your twist and execute a left inward block to  the outside of his left elbow (the action from both of these previous moves will have turned him  around so that his back is toward you).","Immediately execute a right front crossover sweep to the back of his left knee, and as you plant  down, your right underhand claw comes up between his legs (from behind) to claw his groin. Your  left hand is horizontal and palm out to check his arms at the elbows.","Now unpivot counter clockwise and go right into a right rear scoop kick to his groin and with  scoop still in the air plant back in between his legs landing in a right reverse bow stance buckling  his right leg, as you execute a right outward heel of palm strike to his kidneys.","Now execute an in-place stance change (right foot up and then left foot back) into a left reverse  bow stance to buckle his left knee, as you execute a left outward and back elbow strike to his face  simultaneously with your right heel of palm to his ribs (fingers out).","Now execute a left front crossover to 7:00 o'clock as you execute an inverted outward horizontal  'Cobra Strike' (as you return your hand from the strike anchor your elbow).","Double cover out to 6:00 o'clock."]
