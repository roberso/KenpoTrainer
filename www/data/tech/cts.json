["With feet together, step forward and to your left with your left foot to 11 o'clock into a horse stance. Simultaneously deliver a cross block (your right hand over your left) to the wrist of the attacking hand. At this point your cross block should be angled off to 1 o'clock so that your head and body are outside of the line of attack.","Immediately grab your opponent's right wrist with both of your hands, with your left hand facing you and your right hand turned away from you.","Step forward toward 11 o'clock with your right foot as you circle opponent's right arm down and clockwise while striking the club against your opponent's right knee; continue to circling motion around and up and over your head.","Retain your grab with your left hand as your right hand grabs outer end of opponent's club.","Immediately circle your left foot counter clockwise and further back to 9 o'clock (into a right neutral bow) as your right hand forces the club out of your opponent's grasp. Circle your right arm counter clockwise and strike your opponent's right elbow with the club.","Right front crossover and cover out twice toward 9 o'clock."]
