["With opponent cross choking you (with his left hand over his right) and you're facing him, pin his hands with your left hand (making sure greater pressure is on his left hand) as you step forward with your right foot to 12 o'clock (into a right neutral bow) buckling your opponent's right knee from the inside. With this step, deliver a right glancing forearm strike against opponent's left elbow to break it. Continue this action and end up with a right vertical punch to opponent's face.","Immediately deliver a left uppercut to opponent's stomach as your right arm horizontally checks both arms of opponent. (Drop into a right forward bow in the process.)","Follow-up with a left extended outward hooking parry outside of opponent's left elbow followed by a right chopping punch to opponent's left kidney as your left foot shifts to 4 o'clock (still remaining in a right neutral bow).","Continue the same motion of your right arm and switch the orbit of your right arm by using a right vertical back knuckle thrust to opponent's left temple.","Right front crossover and cover out twice toward 4 o'clock."]
