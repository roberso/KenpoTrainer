["From a right neutral bow, slide your left foot counter clockwise to 4 o'clock; simultaneously use a right inward and left outward parry outside of opponent's left punch. Without any loss of motion, the right inward parry continues and becomes a right horizontal outward back knuckle as it strikes to opponent's left ribcage.","Immediately shift your weight onto your left leg and deliver a right looping downward round- house kick to back of opponent's left knee complimenting the angle of your opponent's thigh. (As this kick is executed, kick with the instep of your right foot and make sure that your right ankle is locked straight out.)","Right front crossover and cover out to 4 o'clock."]
