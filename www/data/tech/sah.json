["While you are standing naturally, your opponent (standing between 3:00 and 4:00) grabs your right shoulder with his left hand. Step off and to your right with your right foot toward 3:00 into a horse stance, facing 12:00 while striking your opponent's throat with a right outward handsword. Simultaneous with this action pin your opponent's left hand to your right shoulder with your left hand.","As your opponent reacts to your handsword strike and bends backward, execute a right back hammerfist strike to your opponent's groin."]
