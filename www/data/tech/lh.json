["With feet in line with each other and body bent forward, step forward with your right foot toward 11 o'clock and deliver a right upward vertical reverse hand sword to opponent's groin while simultaneously having your left hand check opponent's right thigh just above the knee and your chin turned in such a position so as to keep your breathing constant. (Turn your chin to the right and tuck it against your chest.)","Immediately follow-up with a right vertical obscure elbow strike to opponent's jaw while keeping in a low right neutral bow.","After snapping the elbow to opponent's jaw loop your right elbow and strike again (shuffling forward if needed) having it drive from 1 o'clock down to 7 o'clock to the left side of opponent's jaw as your left heel of palm hooks in and strikes opponent's right jaw thus causing a sandwiching effect."]
