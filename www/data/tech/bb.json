["While standing naturally with both feet together, step slightly back and to your right with your right foot to 5 o'clock (left neutral bow); simultaneously blocking opponent's left kick (from the outside) with a left downward block as your right hand cocks to your right hip, clenched and palm up.","Deliver a right ball kick (as you pivot counter clockwise and in place with your left foot) to opponent~s groin (from the rear) while his back is toward you. Upon doing so have your left hand shift to an extended outward but relaxed hand sword to act as a check in covering your head area while your right hand opens (palm up).","Plant your right foot (into a modified right front twist stance for purposes of torque) and deliver a left knife-edge kick to the inside of opponent's right knee. (Keeping both of your now open hands in a defensive position.)","Left front crossover and cover out to 4 o'clock."]
