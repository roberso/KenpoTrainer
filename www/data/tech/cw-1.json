["With feet together, have your left foot step forward and to your right on a 45 degree angle (2 o'clock) into a left neutral bow as your right arm cocks horizontally across your waist.","Pivot clockwise (turning toward 8 o'clock) as you circle your right elbow over and down (right outward overhead elbow) onto the right arm of your opponent to hurt and pin that arm. Complete the pivot into a right forward bow (facing 8 o'clock) while delivering a left four finger thrust to opponent's eyes.","Pivot in place to your left into a horse as you deliver a right upward elbow strike to opponent's chin. Your left hand should be guarding close to your right ribs.","Pivot again to your left (toward 2 o'clock) into a right reverse bow as you strike with a right back downward hammer fist to opponent's groin with your left hand guarding."]
