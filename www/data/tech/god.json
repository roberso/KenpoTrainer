["With opponent applying lock from your left side, step forward and to your left (to 10 o'clock) with your right foot (into a right close kneel) while turning your head to the left and tucking your chin against your chest.  Simultaneously deliver a right hammer fist to opponent's groin and a left hammer fist to opponent's kidney.","As you pivot into a left forward bow facing 6 o'clock, have the fingers of your left hand press under opponent's nose or, depending upon the circumstances, have your left hand grab opponent's hair to force opponent's head back.","Immediately follow-up with a right heel of palm thrust to opponent's chin as you pivot into a left forward bow. However, make sure that the head of your opponent in either of the above cases is arched and forced back and down to minimize your opponent's leverage thus preventing him from executing a right knee kick to your groin area."]
