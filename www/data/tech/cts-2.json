["With feet together, step slightly forward and to your left with your right foot (to 12 o'clock) as your opponent steps through with his right foot, delivering a right roundhouse club attack.","As you step in, execute a left extended outward block to inside of opponent's right wrist. Simultaneously deliver a right vertical punch to opponent's jaw or face.","Immediately pivot into a right forward bow (facing 12 o'clock). Check opponent's right arm with a right inward parry as your left vertical fist shoots over your right arm striking to opponent's solar plexus or ribcage.","Drop back (in place) into a right neutral bow as you deliver a right horizontal back knuckle to opponent's right floating ribs while having your left hand execute a left extended outward hand sword or left hooking check (palm up) can also act as a parry aside from being a check."]
