Simultaneously deliver a right heel palm strike (fingers are horizontal and fingertips are pointed toward 9 o'clock) to opponent's left chin.","Have your right foot sweep opponent's right foot toward 6 o'clock as your right hand slides down opponent's arm (checking opponent's arm down to his right wrist).

At the time of contact with your left finger poke you should be in a right one legged stance in preparation for a kick.","From your one legged stance, deliver a right knife-edge kick to inside of opponent's left knee.","As you plant your right foot forward (into a right neutral bow) switch your left finger poke to a left hand grab to opponent's right wrist (sliding and checking your opponent's right arm on the way back).
