["With opponent applying lock from your left side, step forward and to your left with your right foot (toward ten o'clock while going into a right close kneel, assuming both of you are facing twelve o'clock) while turning your head to the left and tucking your chin against your chest so as not to have your air supply cut off. Simultaneously deliver a right hammer fist to opponent's groin and a left hammer fist to opponent's left kidney.","As you pivot into a left neutral bow (facing six o'clock), the fingers of your left hand presses under opponent's nose to force opponent's head back.","Immediately follow-up by striking with your right heel of palm to opponent's chin as you pivot into a left forward bow.","With your left foot somewhat to the side and back of opponent's right leg, have your left foot sweep opponent's right foot toward ten o'clock ending in a left front twist stance.","Have your right foot shift toward six o'clock (a short step) pivoting slightly clockwise and immediately shoot your left foot back toward eight o'clock into a reverse bow to buckle opponent's left inner knee.","Left front crossover (toward two o'clock) and cover out twice."]
