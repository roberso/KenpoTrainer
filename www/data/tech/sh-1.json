["Standing naturally with feet together, step back with your left foot to 6 o'clock into a right neutral bow as you deliver a right extended outward block to the inside of opponent's left hooking punch at his forearm as your left hand guards your right ribcage.","Immediately deliver a right inward raking back knuckle strike to opponent's bridge of nose.","Shuffle forward while continuing the counter clockwise motion of your right hand and follow-up with a right horizontal dipping outward elbow strike to opponent's solar plexus as your left hand checks high for a possible heel palm and claw to opponent's face."]
