["Standing with feet together, drop back with your left foot (to 6 o'clock) into a right neutral bow as you simultaneously hook in (to your left) with the heel of your right palm to outside of opponent's left elbow joint while hooking in (to your right)with the heel of your left palm to inside of opponent's left inner wrist (utilizing opposing forces) to cause an elbow break.","Have your right hand (while forming the shape of the crane) hook opponent's left arm counter clockwise and out (to your right) while simultaneously executing a left thrusting chop (palm down) directly to the throat of your opponent; this is done as you shuffle forward with a push drag maneuver. Without any loss of motion continue the counter clockwise motion of your right hand so that the knuckles of that hand execute an inward diagonal rake across the bridge of opponent's nose in order to cause a break.","Continue the same counter clockwise motion of your right arm and execute a right inward horizontal elbow strike to opponent's left jaw as your left heel of palm strikes to opponent's right jaw thus creating a sandwiching effect."]
