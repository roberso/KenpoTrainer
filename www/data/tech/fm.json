["With feet together, step to 11 o'clock with your left foot (into a left neutral bow) as your left inward blocks the outside of your opponent's right punch at or above the elbow. Simultaneously with the block, cock your right hand above your right shoulder (palm out).","Immediately step through with your right foot to 10 o'clock (into a transitional right neutral bow) as you deliver a right inward horizontal knuckle rake to opponent's right cheek bone or temple with your left hand still guarding.","Without any hesitation pivot counterclockwise (you're now facing 4 o'clock) and strike to opponent's right ribcage with a left horizontal outward back knuckle strike and in the same motion, have your right hand execute an inward heel of palm bracing check to opponent's right upper arm.","After delivering a right inward bracing check against opponent's right arm follow-up with a left outward check (left hand looks like a waiter carrying a tray). As you drop into a left close kneel stance continue the motion of your right arm and without loss of motion, have your right hand circle counterclockwise as you loop a right overhead back knuckle strike to opponent's face or temple while executing marriage of gravity.","Left front crossover and cover out to 10 o'clock."]
