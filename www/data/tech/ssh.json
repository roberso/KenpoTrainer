["Drop back with your right foot (to 6 o'clock) into a left neutral bow.  Simultaneously hook your left hand around and back of opponent's head so that your left knuckle or left inner wrist bone strikes to opponent's left temple or mastoid while your right hand cocks into a half fist at chest level.","Immediately have your left hand grab and pull opponent's hair back (above the forehead) as you shift into a left forward bow (toward 12 o'clock) and execute a thrusting half fist to opponent's throat, immediately returning to your left neutral bow after the half fist strike."]
