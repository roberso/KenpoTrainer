["Standing naturally, step back (to 6 o'clock) with your left foot when your opponents grabs your lapel with his left hand. Simultaneously pin his left hand to your chest with your left hand and deliver a right upward strike against his left elbow just above the joint thus causing the elbow to break as you pivot into a right neutral bow.","Then circle your right arm over and down (counter clockwise) with an nward-downward strike against opponent's left forearm. Make sure that your opponent's left arm is driven down and diagonally to your left.","After cocking your right hand slightly toward you with your right palm up, deliver a right outward chop to the right side of opponent's neck; stance throughout is still a right neutral bow. Cock your left hand at your solar plexus, ready to check when needed."]
