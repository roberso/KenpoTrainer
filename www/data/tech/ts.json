Simultaneously have your left hand check high (left extended outward but relaxed hand sword) for possible head shots.","As you plant your right foot forward toward 11 o'clock (between opponent's legs and into a right neutral bow), deliver a right torquing heel of Palm thrust to opponent's jaw while your left hand checks near your right ribcage."]
