["Have your left foot step back and to your right on a slight 45 degree angle (between 4 and 5 o'clock) into a left rear twist stance.","Pivot to your left (into a left forward bow) while simultaneously delivering a left outward block to outside of opponent's left arm and a right inward horizontal elbow strike to outside portion of opponent's left ribcage.","Pivot to your right (into a horse facing 9 o'clock) and deliver a left inward horizontal elbow strike to inside portion of opponent's left ribcage or solar plexus as your right hand guards to the left of your face, always making sure that your right hand keeps a safe distance from your head in order to cushion any blow that might be directed to your head."]
