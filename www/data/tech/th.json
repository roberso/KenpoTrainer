["Standing naturally with feet together, step to your left on a 45ยก angle (to 11 o'clock) with your left foot into a left neutral bow as you strike with a left inward block to outside of opponent's right arm (preferably at or above the elbow) and cock your right arm parallel to your right thigh as it hangs naturally to the side.","Shuffle forward (push drag) toward 12 o'clock as you drop into a left wide kneel stance (to outside of opponent's right knee so as to have opponent buckle and drop) and strike horizontally across your opponent's stomach with your right inward horizontal forearm strike while cocking your left arm (your left hand at this point is cocked by your left ear with your palm facing away from you).","Strike down to opponent's left kidney with a left downward hammer fist as your right arm checks opponent's right arm. You should be in a right close kneel stance facing 4 o'clock.","Have your left hand shift from the kidney into a horizontal forearm check outside of opponent's right arm as your right arm cocks to your right ear. You should still be in a right close kneel stance facing 4 o'clock.","Pivot to your left (toward 1 o'clock) into a left close kneel stance as you deliver a right downward hammer fist to back of opponent's neck; your left hand at this point is still checking action of opponent's right arm (left pushdown check).","Shift your left foot back and slightly to your left (between 7 and 8 o'clock) into a right neutral bow and do a right looping back knuckle strike to opponent's left temple. Shuffle toward 2 o'clock with a right upward heel palm and claw to opponent's face and execute a right front crossover and cover out toward 8 o'clock."]
