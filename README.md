# KenpoTrainer
Martial Arts Training Tool written in Apache Cordova

## Background and Purpose
I originally wrote this years ago using the IBM Mobile First platform as an experiment back in 2015.  I had promised my instructor that I would share others, but as with all things, I lost the source to it over the years.  Luckily I had a copy of the APK build from the source and I was able to extract the source files from there.  Since I was targeting something eaiser to share, I created this project to port it over to Apache Cordova.

I've studied Kenpo for years and I've worked in the computer industry for decades.  So I looked for a while for a mobile tool that I could use to study with while on the road.  To that end, I created this project.  This is a tool based on Ed Parker's American Kenpo Karate and originally developed by Kenn Roberson, a Kenpo black belt. Material contained in this tool is compiled from the internet, old student manuals, and personal knowledge.

The following are good sites for more information on Kenpo
- [Texas Storm Kenpo](http://www.texasstormkenpo.com/)
- [The KenpoNet](http://www.kenponet.com/)
- [PCWood's Kenpo Site](http://pcwood.com/kenpo/)

I take no responsibility or liability for its use or any injury or damage that may incur while using the app or accuracy of the content found in the app. Please use responsibly and at your own risk.

This tool is to be used as a supplement to receiving real lessons from a trained Kenpo instructor. This app is focused on providing information and drills on retaining and expanding on Kenpo knowledge.  It is not a replacement for a knowledgable instructor.

## Development
This section talks to the software needed to develop this tool.

### Software Setup
You will need the following installed and setup:
- [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). I used 8.1.x
- xcode v10 (I'm running a mac with Mojave)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/). I used 3.2.x 

I also applied the cordova patch listed at https://gist.github.com/ShenTengTu/1e389f1a1a9a32a6a143e8d77259939b.
